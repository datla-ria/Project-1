# Project-1

# Project Title: Global Stock Markets and Covid Cases

# Project Industry: Healthcare and Finance

# Project Description: 
Exploratory analysis of the covid cases and stock market performance over the same timeframe

# Project Overview
The point of the project was to see the relationship between the major world stock market indexes and Covid cases. In order to do this we must analyse the Covid information and present why that is significant. Then we must present the stock index information and  why it is significant. Then only can we see the relationship.

# Project Objectives:
1. Data gathering, cleaning and understanding the data
2. Identify top 5 and bottom 5 countries' Covid cases and death totals
3. Explore the correlation between the total amount of cases and deaths and stock market performance for the 10 elected countries.
4. Data Visualization and presentation of our findings

# Data Sources:
Covid-19 Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/data-on-covid19-coronavirus
Workldwide Stock market Indices Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mukhazarahmad/worldwide-stock-market-indices-data

# Key Research Questions:
1. What is the structure of the covid dataset and what patterns can we identify?
2. What is the structure of the indices dataset and what patterns can we identify?
3. What are the countries in the dataset with the most covid cases?
3. What is the relationship between Covid cases in the listed countries and the stock market performance for a major index in that country?

# Process

1. Data Collection
    Obtained data for the same time period for Covid-19 and stock indices
2. Data Preparation
    Created a dataframe for the necessary fields in  the Covid and Indices Datasets
3. Data Analysis
4. Visualization
5. Conclusion

# Usage and Installation
N/A This is a statistical analysis. Run the file to generate visualizations and results.

# Results of application
The application starts off by analysing the data frames. It then gives you graphs of the total cases over time. Further, it produces a bar graph showing you the prevalence rate and the total cases for each country. Further, the dta is cleaned to give you max cases for each country in the form of a data frame. Currently, it shows top 10 cases. Next the project shows you the stock market overtime in a line graph to see the trends in all indexes. The data is then combined with the covid and stock data to see the total cases over time, the prevalence rate over time, and the stock volume over time. In the end a linear regression is done to see the true relationship with the stock market and Covid cases

# Summary of the analysis
TO summarize, the results show us a couple of major points. First, we see that the United States had the most total cases of Covid. However, after taking a prevalence rate, a proprtion based on the population that shows the true burden of disease, we found that France was hit harder during the Covid pandemic amongst top 5 countries. We see during the Covid pandemic that the stalk market crashes around 2020 amongst all stock indexes. However, when a linear regression was done we found that there is no significant correlation between the relationship of total cases and the stock market. Our r2 value was 0.04 which shows no statiscal significance. Other observation we see are that the more volue of investments during Covid were poured into USA and China. The future implication of this project are that we can first analyse the top countries and see which countries were hit the hardest. This allows public health researchers to do further studies as to why these countries were hit hard, what was there Covid protocol, and how they can be better prepared for a futurew pandemmic next time. For example in our study we see that China controlled there Covid cases well until 2023. So researchers and policy makers can try to assess what went wrong in that population around that time. Next, our research shows that there is no significant correlation between the stock market and a pandemic. Therefore, we need to ask ourselves should people continue to invest there money in the top indexes during the pandemic and are there ways to make extra return. In order to do that our project is a good base for others to see one pandemic and future studies are needed to see the relationship between the stock market and other pandemics to get a better grasp of the relationships between pandemics and the stock market.

# Additional Questions
In the future we would analyze population densities, policies to identify spikes, and travel.
We would add additional data related to other pandemics to identify trends and prepare for future events.
